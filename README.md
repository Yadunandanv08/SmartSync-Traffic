# SmartSync-Traffic

To solve the problem of traffic accidents, we propose the development and implementation of
new AI-based traffic management systems. The solution involves installing sensors at major
intersections in the city with real-time data on the number of passing vehicles and then using
an advanced AI model that can dynamically analyse traffic and handle the data collected.
The AI model will use machine learning algorithms to predict and anticipate traffic
conditions at every intersection. By continuously learning from incoming data, the system
will optimise and optimise traffic light timing in real time. Specifically, the AI model will
dynamically adjust the duration of the green, yellow, and red lights based on the current
traffic forecast. This proactive approach aims to eliminate complex traffic accidents and
reduce congestion by providing smooth transitions between intersections.
Utilizing Google Cloud, our YOLO-trained model performs real-time vehicle detection, capturing 
images and storing them alongside Green Signal Time (GST) and vehicle counts. This data, stored on Google Cloud,
facilitates thorough analysis, aiding in traffic prediction and enhancing overall traffic management efficiency.
